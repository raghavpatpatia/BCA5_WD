    <h1>Backtracking</h1>
    Copyright &copy;2002 by David Matuszek
    <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
    <p>The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you
    must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of 
    options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This 
    procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a 
    good sequence of choices, your final state is a <em>goal state</em>; if you didn't, it isn't.</p>
    <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good 
    leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad. 
    You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root, you choose one 
    of its children to move to, and you keep this up until you get to a leaf.</p>
    <p>Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can <em>backtrack</em> to continue the 
    search for a good leaf by revoking your <em>most recent</em> choice, and trying 
    out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the 
    choice that got you here, and try another choice at that node. If you end up at the 
    root with no options left, there are no good leaves to be found.</p>
    <p>This needs an example.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Starting at Root, your options are A and B. You choose A.</li>
            <li>At A, your options are C and D. You choose C.</li>
            <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
            <li>D is bad. Go back to A.</li>
            <li>At A, you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
            <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
            <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try E.</li>
            <li>E is good. Congratulations!</li>

    <p>In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract model 
    of the possible sequences of choices we could make. There is also a data structure 
    called a tree, but usually we don't have a data structure to tell us what choices we 
    have. (If we do have an actual tree data structure, backtracking on it is 
    called <i>depth-first tree searching</i>.)</p>
    <br>
    <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
    <p>Here is the algorithm (in pseudocode) for doing backtracking from a given node n:</p>
    <p>
        <code><pre>
            boolean solve(Node n) {
                if n is a leaf node {
                    if the leaf is a goal node, return true
                    else return false
                } else {
                    for each child c of n {
                        if solve(c) succeeds, return true
                    }
                    return false
                }
            }
        </pre></code>
    </p>
    <p>Notice that the algorithm is expressed as a <i>boolean</i> function. This is 
        essential to understanding the algorithm. If <code>solve(n)</code> is true, 
        that means node<code> n </code>is part of a solution--that is, node<code> n 
        </code>is one of the nodes on a path from the root to some goal node. We say 
        that<code> n </code>is <i>solvable</i>. If<code> solve(n) </code>is false, then 
        there is <i>no</i> path that includes<code> n</code> to any goal node.
    </p>
    <p>How does this work?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If any child of<code> n </code>is solvable, then<code> n </code>is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of<code> n </code>is solvable, then<code> n </code>is not solvable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node<code> n </code>is solvable (part of a path to a 
    goal node), all you have to do is test whether any child of<code> n </code>is solvable. This is 
    done recursively, on each child of<code> n. </code>In the above code, this is done by the lines</p>
    <p>
        <code>
        <pre>
            for each child c of n {
                if solve(c) succeeds, return true
            }
            return false
        </pre>   
        </code>
    </p>
